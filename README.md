# bug-tracker
## Abstract
The project was designed and developed to keep track of bugs, issues, and proposals in software. Teams and developers can keep track of all issues and suggestions in one place. The program provides a set of key functions, such as creating and managing teams, projects, and tickets. As an auxiliary function, the program provides the ability to make notes, leave comments in the tickets section, and send messages.

## Languages and technologies used

### Frontend:
TypeScript | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | React | Vite | Npm

## Functional purpose
The functional purpose of a web-based bug-tracking application is to offer a thorough and efficient method for monitoring and managing software defects and issues throughout the software development lifecycle. The software acts as a central hub for collecting, categorizing, prioritizing, and fixing issues identified by users, testers, or other team members. Another program goal is to offer a stable and user-friendly platform that simplifies bug, issue, and proposal monitoring. Also, the program enhances collaboration, simplifies communication, and ensures effective bug management.

## Functional requirements
The application must provide the ability to:
- manage account data;
- register;
- log in to your account (Login);
- change your data;
- view the available information on assigned issues and team members of the organization;
- filter information;
- search needed data through the search system;
- sort by each data field;
- display only the required number of items on the screen;
- view ticket statistics (which bugs are still open, their status, priority, etc.) through graphs;
- change information about tickets to which a user is assigned;
- create new tickets, projects (if the user role is "Submitter"), and new user accounts for their organization (if the user role is "Admin");
- write personal notes about the project or each ticket individually;
- leave comments for each ticket separately;
- attach a file to a ticket.
